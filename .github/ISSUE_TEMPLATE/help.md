If you get stuck and can't figure out what is going on. It's possible other people
will find it useful, and it may be a documentation deficieny (or a bug).

Please browse existing issues and carefully read the documentation first!


**Describe the problem**

A clear and concise description of what you are trying to do.

**What are you trying to achieve**

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Minimal working example**

Please provide a minimal working example that reproduces the issue.

**I would find it useful if...**

Do you think the docs should cover this? (Bear in mind we've not had time to write
really detailed, extensive documentation covering every feature, so your help in writing
would be appreciated.)
