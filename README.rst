FaIR
====

FaIR (the Finite-amplitude Impulse-Response) climate model is a simple climate model, or *emulator*, useful for producing global mean temperature projections from a wide range of emissions or prescribed forcing scenarios.

Requirements
------------

- python 3.6+


Installation
------------

Refer to `The Docs`_.

Usage
-----

FaIR can be driven by emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived forcers (SLCFs), concentrations of GHGs, or effective radiative forcing (ERF), with different input methods for different species possible in the same run. If run concentration-driven, emissions are back-calculated. Custom GHGs and SLCFs can be defined, and all components are optional allowing experiments such as pulse-response analyses to single forcers or gathering up non-CO:sub:`2` species as an aggregate forcing.

A really basic example
----------------------

Caution: does not follow the real world. `Basic example`_


A note about calibration and constraint
---------------------------------------

FaIR is naive. It will run whatever climate scenario and climate configuration you give it. If you create a runaway greenhouse effect, a snowball Earth, or violate the laws of physics, FaIR won't judge you. For simple climate models as for complex, garbage in leads to garbage out. We provide some emissions scenarios (the CMIP6 SSPs, as produced by rcmip.org), and reasonably sensible default configurations (as of late 2022) for you to play with. These should not be taken to be best estimates
or up-to-date projections of the historical or future climate.

We have produced IPCC AR6 Working Group 1 consistent probabilistic ensembles elsewhere. These parameter sets are calibrated to CMIP6 models, run in a large Monte Carlo ensemble, and constrained based on six observed or assessed climate metrics. If you're writing a paper using FaIR, you should use these (or at the very least, revert to v1.6 and use the parameter set at https://zenodo.org/record/5513022). Give us time and we'll write this into a paper and release the code; if you want them now, `get in touch`_ and we'll give them to you. We're also working towards releasing annual updates.
