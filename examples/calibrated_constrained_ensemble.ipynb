    "# A calibrated, constrained ensemble\n",
    "\n",
    "FaIR, like every other simple or complex climate model, is naive. It will produce projections for whatever emissions/concentrations/forcing scenario you ask it to produce projections for. It is up to the user to determine whether these projections are useful and sensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are [developing a set of parameter calibrations](https://github.com/chrisroadmap/fair-calibrate) that reproduce both observed climate change since pre-industrial and assessed climate metrics such as the equilibrium climate sensitivity from the IPCC Sixth Assessement Report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibrations will be continually updated, as new data for surface temperature, ocean heat content, external forcing and emissions become available. For now, we have an IPCC AR6 WG1 version (where observational constraints are generally up to somewhere in the 2014 to 2020 period), and assessments of emergent climate metrics are from the IPCC AR6 WG1 Chapter 7. We use emissions data (historical + SSP) from the Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project which was compiled for IPCC AR6 WG3 Chapter 3. We also have calibration versions for replacing historical CO2 emissions by Global Carbon Project estimates. This is v1.1.0 of the `fair-calibrate` package, and can be obtained from the DOI link below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-step constraining process is produced. The first step ensures that historical simulations match observed climate change to a root-mean-square error of less than 0.16°C. The second step simultaneously distribution-fits to the following assessed ranges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), very likely range 2-5°C, best estimate 3°C\n",
    "- transient climate response (TCR), very likely range 1.2-2.4°C, best estimate 1.8°C\n",
    "- global mean surface temperature change 1850-1900 to 1995-2014, very likely range 0.67-0.98°C, best estimate 0.85°C\n",
    "- effective radiative forcing from aerosol-radiation interactions 1750 to 2005-2014, very likely range -0.6 to 0 W/m², best estimate -0.3 W/m²\n",
    "- effective radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions 1750 to 2005-2014, very likely range -1.7 to -0.3 W/m², best estimate -1.0 W/m²\n",
    "- effective radiative forcing from aerosols 1750 to 2005-2014, very likely range -2.0 to -0.6 W/m², best estimate -1.3 W/m²\n",
    "- ocean heat content change 1971 to 2018, likely range 329-463 ZJ, best estimate 396 ZJ\n",
    "- CO2 concentrations in 2014, very likely range 396.95-398.15 ppm, best estimate 397.55 ppm\n",
    "- future warming in SSP245 1995-2014 to 2081-2100, 1.24-2.59°C, best estimate 1.81°C. Note the IPCC constraint was concentration driven, in fair-calibrate v1.1.0 an emissions-driven constraint was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "1001 posterior ensemble members are produced from an initial prior of 1.5 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many, many different calibration and constraining possibilities, and it depends on your purposes as to what is appropriate. If you care about the carbon cycle, you might want to constrain on TCRE and ZEC in addition, or instead of, some of the other constraints above. Not all constraints are necessarily internally consistent, and there will be some tradeoff; it is impossible to hit the above ranges perfectly. As more constraints are added, this gets harder, or will require larger prior sample sizes.\n",
